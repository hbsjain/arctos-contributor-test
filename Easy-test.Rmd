```{r}
require(spocc)
# downloading the occurence of cheetahs into a df object
df <- occ(query = "Acinonyx jubatus")

df <- occ2df(df)
```

## Filter the data to keep records with coordinate uncertainty less than or equal to 1000 meters.
## Filter the data to keep only the columns: species, decimalLongitude, decimalLatitude, day, month, and year.
## Prepare a summary of the number of records after each of the steps described above.
